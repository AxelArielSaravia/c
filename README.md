This is my own wrapper to compile C with the GCC compiler

The idea is to have a set of defaults (warnings, security and standars)
and a set of commands to simplify actions.

Its a short cut for:
* Compilaton
* Compile and run a file, and mantain the executable
* Compile and run a file, and remove the executable
